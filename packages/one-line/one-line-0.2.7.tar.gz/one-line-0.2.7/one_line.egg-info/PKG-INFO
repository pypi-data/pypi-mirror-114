        ## What is it?
        
        It's a personal code set for learning and researching on Data Science and Machine Learning. It contains advanced encapsulation of some libraries, designing to provide a simpler mode of operation and help people to simplify their codes concisely.
        
        > This library is a collection of code used for learning and analysis, and the content is not perfect for the time being.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install this module with command below:
        
        ```
        pip install one-line
        ```
        
        ## How to use it?
        
        Import module and dataset:
        
        ```python
        # import OneData, an extended DataFrame
        from oneline import OneData
        
        # input the data with address, and the format will be set automatically
        data = OneData('test.csv')
        ```
        
        You can also import data using Pandas:
        
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        from oneline import OneData
        
        temp = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
        
        # a DataFrame type data is also acceptable
        data = OneData(temp)
        ```
        
        More example see also `test/test_EDA.py`.
