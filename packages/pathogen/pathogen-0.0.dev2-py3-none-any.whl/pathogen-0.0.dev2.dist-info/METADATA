note that this package is **still in development**
at this stage, I'm only building thing as they come to mind  
version 1.0 will be the first major release  
until then, consider this code heavily volatile

yet, install simply by calling `pip install pathetic` or `pip install --pre pathetic` for the latest
development
release.
