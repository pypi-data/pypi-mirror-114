Description: Inbox event listener for exchangelib
        ====================================
        This library listens for events in the inbox and raises an event.
        
        ## Usage
        Create listener:
        ```python
        from exchangelib import DELEGATE, Account, Credentials, Configuration
        from exchangelib.properties import NewMailEvent, MovedEvent
        from exchangelib_listener import Listener
        
        creds = Credentials(
            username='EMAIL_ADDRESS',
            password='PASSWORD'
        )
        config = Configuration(
            server='SERVER',
            credentials=creds
        )
        acct = Account(
            primary_smtp_address='EMAIL_ADDRESS',
            config=config,
            access_type=DELEGATE
        )
        
        listener = Listener(acct)
        ```
        
        Create a method to call when events are raised:
        ```python
        def events_received(events):
            for event in events:
                if isinstance(event, NewMailEvent):
                    # Do something
                elif isinstance(event, MovedEvent):
                    # Do something
        
        listener.streaming_events_received += events_received
        listener.listen()
        ```
        
        Or receive a single event:
        ```python
        def new_messaged_received():
            # Do something
        
        listener.streaming_event_received += new_messaged_received
        listener.listen(NewMailEvent)
        ```
