#lang-localization
With lang-localization you can translate your program to different languages.
It is not possible translating your program easier.

## How to use
Start by creating a folder named "localization" in the directory where your python file is located. For every language you want to add you need to create a file with the .loc ending in the new directory. For example "de.loc" or "en.loc". 
The inside of the file must look like this:
```
hw = Hello World!
button1 = Press Me
``` 
Your python file must look like this:
```python
import localization

localization.setLang("de") # The string must be the same as the filename of your translation without .loc

print(localization.get("hw"))

randomButtonCreateFunction(text=localization.get("button1"))
```
