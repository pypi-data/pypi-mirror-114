# Log Hooks

A discord webhook logging library

There are no docs as this isn't meant to be used in bots that are sharded or log a lot. Just ping moanie#6598 on discord.py for help (ID: 691406006277898302)

Example:
```py
import discord
import logging
import aiohttp

from loghooks import WebhookHandler

client = discord.Client() # use commands.Bot if you wish. It doesn't make a difference.
handler = WebhookHandler(
    webhook_url = "webhook-url",
    session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
)


@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print("ready")


# actual logging stuff
logger = logging.getLogger("discord")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logger.addHandler(handler)
handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)

client.run("Bot Token")
```
