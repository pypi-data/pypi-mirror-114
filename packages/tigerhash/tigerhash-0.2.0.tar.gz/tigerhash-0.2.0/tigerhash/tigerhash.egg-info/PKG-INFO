        Implementation of tiger hash in C++ with Python API. 
        The basic API matches that of Python's standard [`hashlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) module. 
        
        ## Creators
        
        The algorithm was created by [Ross Anderson and Eli Biham](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/tiger.pdf). 
        It was designed to be a fast, secure hash function which was created for being faster then RIPE-MD, MD5, SHA, SHA1 and Snefru-8 on 64-bit processors.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install tigerhash
        ```
        
        As usual with Pip, you might need to use `sudo` or the `--user` flag
        with the command above, depending on how you installed Python on your
        system.
