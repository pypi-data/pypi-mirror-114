### Making the competitive programming workflow faster, one `Ctrl+S` at a time !

Competitive programming setups suck ! This was the motivation behind creating codemon.

Codemon is a build tool for the terminal, and aims to make the workflow for competitive programming faster than ever. Codemon integrates flawlessly with popular editors such as VSCode, Sublime Text and Vim (‚ù§) !


## Codemon + Vim + Tmux in Action

Like what you see ?

Tmux Left Window - Vim Editor (write code here). <br/>
Tmux Upper Right Window - Compile and run programs. <br/>
Tmux Lower Right Window - Write inputs, if you didn't use "codemon fetch" yet. <br/>
