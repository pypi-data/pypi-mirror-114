# Odak
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/3987171.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/3987171)

Odak (pronounced "O-dac") is the fundamental library for scientific computing in optical sciences. Odak includes modules for geometric [3D raytracing](odak/raytracing/), [Jones calculus](odak/jones), [beam propagation and wave optics](odak/wave) among with [a set of tools](odak/tools) to ease your pain in [measurement](odak/measurement), [exporting/importing CAD](odak/tools/asset.py), and [visualization](odak/visualize) during a design process. We have generated a set of recipes that goes well with machine learning approaches compatible with `torch` learning framework, which can also be found [here](odak/learn). We have created a bunch of [test scripts](test/) for inspiring the way you use odak and helping your design process. For computationally expensive tasks, we have created a [distribution system](odak/manager) to process tasks in parallel across multiple computing resources within the same network. Odak can either run using CPUs or can switch to [NVIDIA GPUs](odak/__init__.py#L8) automatically.

## Getting Started

### Installing
Odak can be installed using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip):

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/kunguz/odak
```

or:

```bash
pip3 install odak
```

### Usage
It is easy as in this recorded session. Import it to your code and start designing your next in Optics!
