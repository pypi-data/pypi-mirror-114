# Contributing

Hi! We're thrilled you're interested in contributing.
There are a lot of ways to get involved, some of which require ZERO background with programming.

Here is what you will need:
1. A GitHub account, so you can partake in discussions in the [Issues](github.com/mathematicalmichael/cafelytics/issues) tab.
2. A bit of patience.

Yup, that's it. 
You can develop code without installing anything by using the links/directions on the [README](../README.md). 
Moreover, you can edit right in GitHub if you're just writing documentation and don't need to run any code.  

Here is how you can get involved:
- Ask questions, make suggestions for improvements by raising an Issue on GitHub.
- Fork the project, improve the code, submit pull requests to this repo.


## General Improvements
- Documentation (is it easy to follow directions?)
