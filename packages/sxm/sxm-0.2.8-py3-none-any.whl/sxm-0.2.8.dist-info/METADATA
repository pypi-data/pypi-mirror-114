.. warning:: Designed for PERSONAL USE ONLY

    ``sxm`` is a 100% unofficial project and you use it at your own risk.
    It is designed to be used for personal use with a small number of users
    listening to it at once. Similar to playing music over a speak from the
    radio directly. Using ``sxm-player`` in any corporate setting, to
    attempt to pirate music, or to try to make a profit off your subscription
    may result in you getting in legal trouble.

``sxm-client`` is a Python library designed to help write applications for the
popular XM Radio service.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: http://sxm-client.readthedocs.io/.

Features
--------

* A simple HTTP Proxy server that can serve HLS streams for sxm-client channels
* Python sxm Client
* Python classes for interface with sxm channel data

For details on usage and installation, see the `documentation`_.

``sxm-client`` is designed to be a bare bones library to setup an anonymous HLS
stream. For a more in-depth applications, check out
`sxm-player`_.
