DESCRIPTION: One or more standard construction per GWR age class for each building element are defined. Fixed construction for internal floor and ceiling.
  There is one IDF per construction, the materials for all constrcutions are defined in one IDF file. The IDF files were created based on the Excel sheets linked below.
