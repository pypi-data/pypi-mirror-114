Description: 
        # pyChemEngg
        
        > This is a python package to facilitate teaching of chemical engineering. The package is still in development stage. When complete, there will be support for different topics such as:
        
        * Material Balances
        * Heat Transfer
        * Fluid Flow
        * Thermodynamics
        * Chemical Reaction Engineering
        * Process Control
        
        
        ## Philosophy
        > The *pyChemEngg* package has the following philosophy:
        * The package should facilitate student learning. The package should not become a black box such that it hides the underlying fundamentals of chemical engineering. Instead the package should reinforce chemical engineering principles, stimulate students to think, promote curiosity, and make learning fun.
        
        
        ## Current status
        * The package for material balances for physical processes (no chemical reaction) is complete.
        * Currently the package for heat transfer is ~70% complete.
        
        
        ## General Information
        * Chemical engineers are now expected to possess programming skills, and python is an attractive language popular in scientific and technical computing. 
        * The *pyChemEngg* package will provide integrated learning experience and will exposes chemical engineering students to the python programming language throughout their degree program.
        
        ## Installation
        * At the moment the package is empty and should not be installed.
