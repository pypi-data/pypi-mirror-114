Description: # edatk: Python Exploratory Data Analysis Toolkit
        
        edatk is a open source project for exploratory data analysis in Python. This is a new project and while features are simple now, the goal is to automate and organize as much of the traditional eda workflow as possible. 
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install edatk
        ```
        
        ## Examples and Getting Started
        ```python
        # Import library
        import edatk as eda
        
        # Load in your dataframe (using seaborn below as an example)
        import seaborn as sns
        df = sns.load_dataset('iris')
        
        # Run auto eda, optionally pass in path for saving html report and target column
        eda.auto_eda(df, save_path='C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\edatk', target_column='species')
        ```
