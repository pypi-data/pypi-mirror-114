# printfuk
Completely override your python print function with complete garbage that sometimes looks approximately correct

# How to
Simply install the package either by downloading this git repository and moving the python source code where it needs to or install it using pip.

## Manual (Not preferred)
Copy the printfuk.py file into the one of the paths listed from the following code:
```
import sys
sys.path
```

## Pip
Make sure pip is installed with `pip --version`.  If you get a version print out, then pip is installed.  Otherwise, [install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). 
Once pip is installed type into a console `pip install printfuk`.  And that's it.

## Importing
All you have to do is write `from printfuk import print` at the top of your python script file, and you will never have to worry about clean, nice looking print messages ever again!
