Usage
-----

This section describes how to install an use this theme.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the ``153597-theme`` package::

    $ pip install 153957-theme


Configure
~~~~~~~~~

In ``sigal.conf.py`` configuration for an album the ``theme`` setting should be
a path to a theme directory. However, since this theme is provided as a Python
package its location might be harder to get. Two options are available for
configuration:

The theme can be configured as a plugin or you can get the path by importing
the package. By setting is as plugin the theme is automatically set.

Set ``theme`` to an empty string and add the theme and menu plugins::

    theme = ''
    plugins = ['153957_theme.theme', '153957_theme.full_menu', …]

The alternative::

    from 153957_theme import theme
    theme = theme.get_path()
    plugins = ['153957_theme.full_menu', …]
