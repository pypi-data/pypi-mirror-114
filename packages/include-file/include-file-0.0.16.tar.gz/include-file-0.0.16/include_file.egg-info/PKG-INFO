# Include File

[![pre-commit](https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

* Managing documentation is challenging as

1. Some information ([ex] setting up git command) might come up in multiple documentation
1. Hard to edit
1. Some files are too large so it's better to put link ([ex] jupyter, data files)
1. Need entire file structure or show different instructions per language ([ex] python, java)

## Usage

* See before and after in tests folder

```sh
make e2etest
```
