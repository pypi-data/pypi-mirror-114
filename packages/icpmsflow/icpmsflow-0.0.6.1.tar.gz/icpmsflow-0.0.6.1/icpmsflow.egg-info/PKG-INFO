        Installation
        ------------
        
        This project is available on pypi and conda in two flavors.  The core package includes only the
        packages needed to perform the data analysis.  This can be installed from pip with
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ pip install icpmsflow
        
        or from conda with
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ conda install -c conda-forge -c wpk-nist icpmsflow
        
        Optionally, include a `-n {env-name}` to specify the install environment.
        
        To install the optional plotting/jupyter dependencies, use either
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ pip install icpmsflow[all]
        
        or
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ conda install -c conda-forge -c wpk-nist icpmsflow-all
        
        
        If you prefer to install from github, use either
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ pip install git+https://github.com/wpk-nist-gov/icpmsflow.git@develop
        
        for basic install, or
        
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ pip install 'git+https://github.com/wpk-nist-gov/icpmsflow.git@develop#egg=icpmsflow[all]'
