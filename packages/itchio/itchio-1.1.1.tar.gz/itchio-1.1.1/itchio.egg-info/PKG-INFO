Description: # itchio-lib
        Since I didn't find one, I made it on my own.
        
        ## Purpose
        Use the REST-API of itch.io in python in a simple way
        
        ## How does it work?
        When you want to use the lib, you first need to create a `Session` object, in which you have to pass your
        API-key. It could look something like this:
        ```py
        import itchio
        
        session = itchio.Session(key)
        ```
        
        If you want to access your games, you can just now create an `GameCollection` object with your session.
        ```py
        gameCollection = itchio.GameCollection(session)
        ```
        After that you can get a game by its `id` or you can just get all of your games.
        ```py
        all_my_games = gameCollection.all()
        ```
        The `all_my_games` variable is now a list containing Game objects. You can now easily access the information of a game.
        ```py
        my_game = all_my_games[0]
        
        print(my_game.views_count)
        ``` 
        ```
        35
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        ```py
        import itchio
        
        session = itchio.Session("1234")
        #                        ^
        #                        This is your API-key
        
        userCollection = itchio.UserCollection(session)
        
        me = userCollection.me()
        
        print(me.username)
        ```
        ```

        ## Installation

        ```
