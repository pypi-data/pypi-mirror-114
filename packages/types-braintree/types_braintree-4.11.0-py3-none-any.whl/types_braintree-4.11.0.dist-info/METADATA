## Typing stubs for braintree

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `braintree` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `braintree`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/braintree. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `955a3e5d9d5a35382ad6d0c24985dcd27df8f7f6`.
