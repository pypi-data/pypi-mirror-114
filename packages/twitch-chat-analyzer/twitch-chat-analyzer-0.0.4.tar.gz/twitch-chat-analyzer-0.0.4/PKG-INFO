Description: # twitch-chat-analyzer-py
        
        Twitch chat analyzer from past broadcasts, designed for Jupyter notebook.
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Installation
        
        The package can be installed by ```pip``` command in terminal 
        
        ```pip install --upgrade twitch-chat-analyzer```
        
        ### Run Jupyter Notebook
        
        The package is mainly intended to be used in Jupyter notebook, but it can still be used in standard Python environment
        
        Instruction to install Jupyter notebook (or newer JupyterLab) is [here](https://jupyter.org/install)
        
        After installation, run the following command in terminal to start Jupyter
        
        ```jupyter notebook``` or ```jupyter-lab```
        
        ### Download chats from past broadcast
        
        notebook.ipynb has examples of statistics functions. 
        
        ```python
        from twitch_chat_analyzer import analyzer
        
        # Create an analyzer object from video ID.
        # Video ID is the last part of the video URL (1234567890 in https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1234567890)
        # If the chat log was not downloaded before, it will download automatically and create an analyzer.
        ann = analyzer.FromVideoId('REPLACE_HERE_TO_VIDEO_ID')
        
        # Some pre-built statistics functions to draw graph
        ann.DrawChatPerMinute(10)  # Chat counts for each N-minute interval
        ann.DrawTopChatters(20)  # Top N viewers with most chats
        ann.DrawTopEmotes(15)  # Top N most used emotes
        
        # If you just want to get the data
        ann.GetChatPerMinute(10)  # Chat counts for each 10-minute interval, list of (offset, count)
        ann.GetTopChatters()  # Viewer names and chat counts, list of (name, chat_count), sorted by chat count
        ann.GetEmoteCounts()  # Emotes and usage counts, list of (emote_name, count), sorted by count
        
        # If you want to handle dataframe yourself
        df = ann.ToDataFrame()
        
        # Some useful functions to deal with dataframe
        df[df['is_sub_notice']]  # Show new/renew subscription notice messages
        df[df['bits'] > 0]  # Show messages with bits
        df['text_body'].apply(len).mean()  # Average chat length (excluding emotes)
        
        ```
        
        ### DataFrame
        
        The dataframe returned from ToDataFrame() has the following columns
        
        | Column name | type | meaning |
        | :---------: | :--: | :-----: |
        | offset | float | Time of the chat, in seconds after stream started |
        | username | str | Twitch login username |
        | display_name | str | Display name in chat, which may not be in English |
        | name | str | Combined name of username and display_name, as displayed in Twitch chat |
        | body | str | Raw chat content, including emote text |
        | text_body | str | Chat content excluding emotes |
        | is_subscriber | bool | if the chatter is a subscriber |
        | bits | int | Amount of bits spent in the chat |
        | is_sub_notice | bool | if the chat is new/renew subscription notice |
