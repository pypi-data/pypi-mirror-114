0.3.0
===============
X   DenseVector
    X   Coercion


X   GNFS

X   Separate key parameters from use? Explains some gaps in functions vs data
    X   ECKey, so it can be used in ECDHE and ECDSA


X   Crypto fingerprinting
    OK  Add PSL to block cipher modes
    X   Add fingerprinter to ACE

X   Timing attack framework
    OK  Build TimingOracle
    X   Time sync
    X   Techniques to increase sync resolution from a lower resolution oracle

X   Document timing attack setup

X   New IoT ciphers

X   DualEC is incredibly slow


X   Composable exploits and ACE
    OK  RUNTIME primitive property/exploit loading
    X   RUNTIME programmatic search

X   Refactor ACE tests
    X   Stop weird three-function thing
    X   Rename variables (what is enc_perm?)

X   Does 'exploit.py/register_knowns' need to exist any more? Why not just use decorators?
X   ACE should be able to enumerate all attack paths
