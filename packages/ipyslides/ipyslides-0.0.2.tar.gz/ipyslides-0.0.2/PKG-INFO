        # Usage
        ```python
        import ipyslides as isd 
        
        isd.initilize() #This will create a title page and parameters in same cell
        
        isd.insert(1) #This will create a slide in same cell where you run it 
        
        isd.insert_style() #This will create a %%html cell with custom style
        
        isd.insert_after(1) #This will create as many slides after the slide number 1 as length of list/tuple at cell end
        
        isd.build() #This will build the presentation cell. After this go top and set __slides_mode = True and run all below.
        ```
        > Each command is replaced by its output, so that when you run next time, you don't get duplicate slides. 
        
        > For jupyterlab >= 3, do pip install sidecar for better presenting mode.
