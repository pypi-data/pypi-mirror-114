Description: # ThingsBoard MQTT MicroPython client
        
        This project is a MicroPython library that provides an client for the [Device](https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/mqtt-api/) API of [ThingsBoard](https://thingsboard.io/) open-source IoT Platform.
        
        The library consists of a thin wrapper around the MicroPython MQTT module, [umqtt.robust](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/umqtt.robust/umqtt/robust.py).
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install using pip:
        
        ```python
        import upip
        upip.install('thingsboard-micropython')
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Client initialization and telemetry publishing:
        
        ```python
        from uthingsboard.client import TBDeviceMqttClient
        
        # See examples for more authentication options
        client = TBDeviceMqttClient('demo.thingsboard.io', access_token='test01')
        
        # Connecting to ThingsBoard
        client.connect()
        
        # Sending telemetry
        telemetry = {'temperature': 41.9, 'enabled': False}
        client.send_telemetry(telemetry)
        
        # Checking for incoming subscriptions or RPC call requests (non-blocking)
        client.check_msg()
        
        # Disconnecting from ThingsBoard
        client.disconnect()
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        
        More examples can be found in [examples](https://github.com/coredumplabs/thingsboard-micropython/tree/main/examples) directory.
        
        ## Support
        
        - SSL and QoS (0 or 1) as supported by the backend MQTT library, [umqtt.robust](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/umqtt.robust/umqtt/robust.py).
        - All [Device](https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/mqtt-api/) API's, except Provisioning.
        - Tested only on ESP32 board running MicroPython v1.16 generic.
        
        ## Acknowledgment
        
        This library is an adapted version of the official [ThingsBoard client SDK for Python](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard-python-client-sdk),
        to run in MicroPython.
