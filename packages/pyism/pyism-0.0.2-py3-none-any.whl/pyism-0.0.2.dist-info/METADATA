# pyISM - Incremental Sequence Models for Python

## What is pyISM?
The pyISM is a Python package implementing a family of Incremental Sequence Models (ISMs) implemented with `tensorflow` with an `scikit-multiflow` API.

## How to install?
PyPI:
> pip install -U pyism

GitHub:
> pip install -U git+https://github.com/alvarolemos/pyism

## What are Incremental Sequence Models (ISMs)?
_Incremental Sequence Models_ are a family of _Recurrent Neural Networks_ (RNNs) to tackle evolving data streams, aiming at less complexity without losing performance. It was proposed in the research _An Incremental Learning approach using Sequence Models_, to be presented by Álvaro Conde Lemos Neto as his Master's degree final dissertation in the _Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering_ (PPGEE) of the _Federal Univeristy of Minas Gerais_ (UFMG), supervisde by Prof. Criatiano Leite de Castro, PhD, both from the _Machine Intelligence And Data Science_ (MINDS) lab.
