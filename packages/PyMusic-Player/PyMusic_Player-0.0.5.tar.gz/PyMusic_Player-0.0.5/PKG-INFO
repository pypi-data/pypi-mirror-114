## Usage

## Example

 ```
# test.py
from PyMusic_Player import Music_Player_GUI

## Make sure all the .MP3 songs besides in the folder
song_dir = 'path/of/songs_dir'

# If you want to give the Icon, make sure you have downloaded proper .ICO file.
icon = 'your.ico'
Music_Player_GUI(song_dir,icon)

## Note 
- I have tried to implement all the functionality, it might have some bugs also. Ignore that or please try to solve that bug.
- It might possible, GUI looks different in your system, so it might be screen size problem, You can set the controls according to your screen. You need to modify `PyMusic_Player.py`
- My AIM is to provide Music Player functionality and one Music Player GUI to OpenSource, so every user can use this in their application.
