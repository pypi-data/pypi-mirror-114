A python library to interact with the UK Houses Of Parliment API


Description
===========

The United Kingdom Houses of Parliment has a publicly available API. The API is documented `here <https://developer.parliament.uk/>`_.

As part of our `crime hotspots analysis programe <https://github.com/Reclaim-The-Night-Leeds/crime-hotspots-uk>`_ we needed a way to get data about parliment in bulk. To this end this module was developed. There are still alot of methods left to implement which we will get round to as we need them. However if you are willing to implement them then please feel free to submit a pull request.
