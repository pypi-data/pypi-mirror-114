That will be fixed in due time, and then this note will disappear into the mists of git history.\n\n\n## What is Ptera?\n\nPtera is a way to probe arbitrary variables in arbitrary functions in your program, for instance to plot their values over time, to get the maximum or minimum value during execution.\n\n* **Keep your program clean**: Queries can be defined outside of your main function, so there is no need to pollute your code with logging or debug code.\n* **Debug and analyze across scopes**: Easily write queries that collect variables at various points in the call stack, or even across different calls. Then, you can analyze them all together.\n* **Tag variables and functions**: Categorize parts of your program to make more general queries.\n\n```python\nfrom ptera import probing, op\n\ndef fact(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    else:\n        return n * fact(n - 1)\n\nwith probing("fact(n) as v") as probe:\n    probe.pipe(op.format("fact({n}) = {v}")).subscribe(print)\n    fact(3)\n    # prints fact(1) = 1; fact(2) = 2; fact(3) = 6\n```\n\n\n## probing\n\nUsage: `with ptera.probing(selector) as probe: ...`\n\nThe **selector** is a specification of which variables in which functions we want to stream through the probe. One of the variables must be the *focus* of the selector, meaning that the probe is triggered when *that* variable is set. The focus may be indicated either as `f(!x)` or `f > x`.\n\nThe **probe** is an instance of [rx.Observable](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY). All of the `rx` [operators](https://rxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference_operators.html) should therefore work with ptera\'s probes (map, reduce, min, max, debounce, etc.)\n\n\n### Example 1: intermediate variables\n\nPtera is capable of capturing any variable in a function, not just inputs and return values:\n\n```python\ndef fact2(n):\n    curr = 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        curr = curr * (i + 1)\n    return curr\n\nwith probing("fact2(i, !curr)") as probe:\n    probe.subscribe(print)\n    fact2(3)\n    # {\'curr\': 1}\n    # {\'curr\': 1, \'i\': 0}\n    # {\'curr\': 2, \'i\': 1}\n    # {\'curr\': 6, \'i\': 2}\n```\n\nThe "!" in the selector above means that the focus is `curr`. This means it is triggered when `curr` is set. This is why the first result does not have a value for `i`. You can use the selector `fact2(!i, curr)` to focus on `i` instead:\n\n```python\nwith probing("fact2(!i, curr)") as probe:\n    probe.subscribe(print)\n    fact2(3)\n    # {\'i\': 0, \'curr\': 1}\n    # {\'i\': 1, \'curr\': 1}\n    # {\'i\': 2, \'curr\': 2}\n```\n\nYou can see that the associations are different (curr is 2 when i is 2, whereas it was 6 with the other selector), but this is simply because they are now triggered when `i` is set.\n\n### Example 2: multiple scopes\n\nA selector may act on several nested scopes in a call graph. For example, the selector `f(x) >> g(y) >> h > z` would capture variables `x`, `y` and `z` from the scopes of three different functions, but only when `f` calls `g` and `g` calls `h` (either directly or indirectly). (Note: `f(x) > g(y) > h > z` is also legal and is supposed to represent direct calls, but it may behave in confusing ways depending on which functions are instrumented globally, so avoid it for the time being).\n\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    return g(x + 1) * g(-x - 1)\n\ndef g(x):\n    return x * 2\n\n# Use "as" to rename a variable if there is a name conflict\nwith probing("f(x) >> g > x as gx") as probe:\n    probe.subscribe(print)\n    f(5)\n    # {\'gx\': 6, \'x\': 5}\n    # {\'gx\': -6, \'x\': 5}\n    g(10)\n    # Prints nothing\n```\n\n### Example 3: sibling calls\n\nSelectors can also specify variables on different paths in the call graph. For example:\n\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    v = g(x + 1) * h(-x - 1)\n    return v\n\ndef g(y):\n    return y * 2\n\ndef h(z):\n    return z * 3\n\nwith probing("f(x, g(y), h(!z))") as probe:\n    probe.subscribe(print)\n    f(10)\n    # {\'z\': -11, \'x\': 10, \'y\': 11}\n```\n\nRemember to set the focus with `!`. It should ideally be on the last variable to be set.\n\nThere is currently no error if you don\'t set a focus, it will simply do nothing, so beware of that for the time being.\n\n### Example 4: tagging variables\n\nUsing annotations, variables can be given various tags, and probes can use these tags instead of variable names.\n\n```python\ndef fishy(x):\n    a: "@fish" = x + 1\n    b: "@fish & @trout" = x + 2\n    return a * b\n\nwith probing("fishy > $x:@trout") as probe:\n    probe.subscribe(print)\n    fishy(10)\n    # {\'x\': 12}\n\nwith probing("fishy > $x:@fish") as probe:\n    probe.subscribe(print)\n    fishy(10)\n    # {\'x\': 11}\n    # {\'x\': 12}\n```\n\n\n## Probe\n\n`Probe` works more or less the same way as `probing`, but it is not a context manager: it just works globally from the moment of its creation. This means that streams created with `Probe` never actually end, so operators that wait for the full stream before triggering, such as `ptera.op.min`, will not work.\n\n```python\nProbe("fact() as result").subscribe(print)\nfact(2)\n# {\'result\': 1}\n# {\'result\': 2}\nfact(3)\n# {\'result\': 1}\n# {\'result\': 2}\n# {\'result\': 6}\n```\n\n## Absolute probes\n\nHere is a notation to probe a function using an "absolute path" in the module system:\n\n```python\nProbe("/xyz.submodule/Klass/method > x")\n\n# is mostly equivalent to:\n\nfrom xyz.submodule import Klass\nProbe("Klass.method > x")\n```\n\nThe slashes represent a physical nesting rather than object attributes. For example, `/module.submodule/x/y` means:\n\n* Go in the file that defines `module.submodule`\n* Enter `def x` or `class x` (it will *not* work if `x` is imported from elsewhere)\n* Within that definition, enter `def y` or `class y`\n\nNote:\n\n* Unlike the normal notation, the absolute notation bypasses decorators: `/module/function` will probe the function inside the `def function(): ...` in `module.py`, so it will work even if the function was wrapped by a decorator (unless the decorator does not actually call the function).\n* Although the `/module/function/closure` notation can theoretically point to closures, **this does not work yet.** (It will, eventually.)\n* Use `/module.submodule/func`, *not* `/module/submodule/func`. The former roughly corresponds to `from module.submodule import func` and the latter to `from module import submodule; func = submodule.func`, which can be different in Python. It\'s a bit odd, but it works that way to properly address Python quirks.\n\n\n## Operators\n\nAll the existing [operators](https://rxpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference_operators.html) defined in the `rx` package should be compatible with `Probe` and `probing`. They may be imported as `ptera.operators` or `ptera.op` *In addition to this*, `ptera.operators` defines the following operators:\n\n### Utility\n\n* **`format(string)`**: format each item of the stream (like str.format)\n* **`getitem(name)`**: extract an item from a stream of dicts\n* **`keymap(fn)`**: calls a function using kwargs from a stream of dicts\n* **`throttle(duration)`**: alias for `rx.operators.throttle_first`\n\n### Arithmetic\n\n* **`roll(n, reduce=None, key_mapper=None, seed=None)`**: transform a stream into rolling windows of size at most n. Successive windows overlap completely except for the first and last elements.\n  * If reduce is provided, it is called with arguments `(last, add, drop, last_size, current_size)`\n  * If transform is provided, it is called on each element\n* **`rolling_average(n, key_mapper=None)`**: efficient implementation of a rolling average (mean of the last n elements)\n* **`rolling_average_and_variance(n, key_mapper=None)`**: efficient implementation of a rolling average and (sample) variance of the last n elements, returned as a tuple.\n\n\n## Query language\n\nHere is some code annotated with queries that will match various variables. The queries are not exhaustive, just examples.\n\n* The semicolon ";" is used to separate queries and it is not part of any query.\n* The hash character "#" *is* part of the query if there is no space after it, otherwise it starts a comment.\n\n```python\nfrom ptera import ptera, tag\n\nAnimal = tag.Animal\nThing = tag.Thing\n\n@tooled\ndef art(a, b):               # art > a ; art > b ; art(!a, b) ; art(a, !b)\n\n    a1: Animal = bee(a)      # a1 ; art > a1 ; art(!a1) ; art > $x\n                             # a1:Animal ; $x:Animal\n                             # art(!a1) > bee > d  # Focus on a1, also includes d\n                             # art > bee  # This refers to the bee function\n                             # * > a1 ; *(!a1)\n\n    a2: Thing = cap(b)       # a2 ; art > a2 ; art(!a2) ; art > $x\n                             # a2:Thing ; $x:Thing\n\n    return a1 + a2           # art > #value ; art(#value as art_result)\n                             # art() as art_result\n                             # art > $x\n\n\n@tooled\ndef bee(c):\n    c1 = c + 1               # bee > c1 ; art >> c1 ; art(a2) > bee > c1\n                             # bee > c1 as xyz\n\n    return c1                # bee > #value ; bee(c) as bee_value\n\n\n@tooled\ndef cap(d: Thing & int):     # cap > d ; $x:Thing ; cap > $x\n                             # art(bee(c)) > cap > d\n    return d * d\n```\n\n* The `!` operator marks the **focus** of the query. There will be one result for each time the focus is triggered, and when using `tweak` or `rewrite` the focus is what is being tweaked or rewritten.\n  * Other variables are supplemental information, available along with the focus in query results. They can also be used to compute a value for the focus *if* they are available by the time the focus is reached.\n  * The nesting operators `>` and `>>` automatically set the focus to the right hand side if the rhs is a single variable and the operator is not inside `(...)`.\n* The wildcard `*` stands in for any function.\n* The `>>` operator represents **deep nesting**. For example, `art >> c1` encompasses the pattern `art > bee > c1`.\n  * In general, `a >> z` encompasses `a > z`, `a > b > z`, `a > b > c > z`, `a > * > z`, and so on.\n* A function\'s return value corresponds to a special variable named `#value`.\n* `$x` will match any variable name. Getting the variable name for the capture is possible but requires the `map_full` method. For example:\n  * Query: `art > $x`\n  * Getting the names: `results.map_full(lambda x: x.name) == ["a1", "a2", "#value"]`\n  * Other fields accessible from `map_full` are `value`, `names` and `values`, the latter two being needed if multiple results are captured together.\n* Variable annotations are preserved and can be filtered on, using the `:` operator. However, *Ptera only recognizes tags* created using `ptera.Tag("XYZ")` or `ptera.tag.XYZ`. It will not filter over types.\n* `art(bee(c)) > cap > d` triggers on the variable `d` in calls to `cap`, but it will *also* include the value of `c` for all calls to `bee` inside `art`.\n  * If there are multiple calls to `bee`, all values of `c` will be pooled together, and it will be necessary to use `map_all` to retrieve the values (or `map_full`).\n',
