figpy was created to speed up the GUI-development process in Python. It uses the well-known design software [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to make creating beautiful Tkinter GUIs in Python a piece of cake.

figpy uses the Figma API to analyse a design file and create the respective code and files needed for the GUI. Even figpy's GUI is created using figpy.
