    """Multi-image super resolution (MISR) dataset from the PROBA-V Super Resolution Competition
    https://kelvins.esa.int/proba-v-super-resolution/home/

    'We collected satellite data from the PROBA-V mission of the European Space Agency from 74 hand-selected
    regions around the globe at different points in time. The data is composed of radiometrically and geometrically
    corrected Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectances for the RED and NIR spectral bands at 300m and 100m resolution
    in Plate CarrÃ©e projection. The 300m resolution data is delivered as 128x128 grey-scale pixel images, the 100m
    resolution data as 384x384 grey-scale pixel images. The bit-depth of the images is 14, but they are saved in a
    16-bit .png-format (which makes them look relatively dark if opened in typical image viewers).

    Each image comes with a quality map, indicating which pixels in the image are concealed
    (i.e. clouds, cloud shadows, ice, water, missing, etc) and which should be considered clear. For an image to be
    included in the dataset, at least 75% of its pixels have to be clear for 100m resolution images, and 60% for
    300m resolution images. Each data-point consists of exactly one 100m resolution image and several 300m resolution
    images from the same scene. In total, the dataset contains 1450 scenes, which are split into 1160 scenes for
    training and 290 scenes for testing. On average, each scene comes with 19 different low resolution images and
    always with at least 9. We expect you to submit a 384x384 image for each of the 290 test-scenes, for which we
    will not provide a high resolution image.'
