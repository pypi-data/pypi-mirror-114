    """
    Modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to orthogonalize the vector
    ``v`` against a subset of the column vectors in the array ``V``.

    ``V`` is 1D array of the length ``vector_size * num_vectors`` to represent
    a 2D array of a set of ``num_vectors`` column vectors, each of the length
    ``vector_size``. The length of ``v`` is also ``vector_size``.

    ``v`` is orthogonalized against the last ``ortho_depth`` columns of ``V``.

        * If ``ortho_depth`` is zero, no orthogonalization is performed.
        * If ``ortho-depth`` is negative (usually set to ``-1``), then ``v`` is
          orthogonalized against all column vectors of ``V``.
        * If `ortho_depth`` is larger than ``num_vectors``, then ``v`` is
          orthogonalized against all column vectors of ``V``.
        * If ``ortho-depth`` is smaller than ``num_vectors``, then ``v`` is
          orthogonalized against the last ``orth-depth`` column vectors of
          ``V``.

    The result of the newer ``v`` is written in-place in ``v``.

    :param V: 1D coalesced  array of vectors representing a 2D array.
        The length of this 1D array is vector_size*num_vectors, which indicates
        a 2D array with the shape ``(vector_size, num_vectors)``.
    :type V: C pointer (DataType)

    :param vector_size: The length of each vector. If we assume ``V`` indicates
        a 2D vector, this the number of rows of ``V``.

    :param num_vector: The number of column vectors. If we assume ``V``
        indicates a 2D vector, this the number of columns of ``V``.
    :type num_vectors: int

    :param ortho_depth: The number of vectors to be orthogonalized starting
        from the last vector. ``0`` indicates no orthogonalization will be
        performed and the function just returns. A negative value means all
        vectors will be orthogonalized. A poisitive value will orthogonalize
        the given number of vectors. This value cannot be larger than the
        number of vectors.
    :type ortho_depth: FlagType

    :param v: The vector that will be orthogonalized against the columns of
        `V``. The length of ``v`` is ``vector_size``. This vector is modified
        in-place.
    :param v: C pointer (DataType)

    :param vector_size: The length of each vector. This the number of rows of
        ``basis`` as a 2D array.

        of ``basis`` as a 2D array.

    Orthogonalizes set of vectors mutually using modified Gram-Schmidt process.

    .. note::

        Let ``m`` be the number of vectors (``num_vectors``), and let ``n`` be
        the size of each vector (``vector_size``). In general, ``n`` is much
        larger (large matrix size), and ``m`` is small, in order of a couple of
        hundred. But for small matrices (where ``n`` could be smaller then
        ``m``), then each vector can be orthogonalized at most to ``n`` other
        vectors. This is because the dimension of the vector space is ``n``.
        Thus, if there are extra vectors, each vector is orthogonalized to
        window of the previous ``n`` vector.

        will be modified in-place and will be output of this function. Note
        this is Fortran ordering, meaning that the first index is contiguous.
        Hence, to call the i-th vector, use ``&vectors[0][i]``. Here, iteration
        over the first index is continuous.
