# dstkc
data science toolkit and storage container

This toolkit is meant to be a storage container that organizes your data and data science
models so that it is easy to work with.  This class acts as both a pre-processor, as well
as a storage container

:param df: Pandas dataframe for

:param model: data science model

:param y_col: column in df that contains dependent variable

:param x_cols: columns in df that contain independent variables

:param train_test_split_params: parameters for sci-kit learn's train test split function
    see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html
    for reference

other attributes include:

:attr train_data - pandas dataframe with all training data

:attr test_data - pandas dataframe with all testing data


:attr x_data - pandas dataframe with all x data

:attr y_data - pandas dataframe with all y data


:attr x_test - pandas dataframe with all x testing data

:attr x_train - pandas dataframe with all x training data

:attr x_test_array - numpy array with all x testing data

:attr x_train_array - numpy array with all x training data


:attr y_test - pandas dataframe with all y testing data

:attr y_train - pandas dataframe with all y training data

:attr y_test_array - numpy array with all y testing data

:attr y_train_array - numpy array with all y training data

:attr model - store your model here for later use

:attr predictions - store your model's predictions here

:attr score - store a scoring or performance metric here

:attr notes - place for you to store any and all notes
