    """Accumulate events to frames by slicing along constant time (time_window),
    constant number of events (spike_count) or constant number of frames (n_time_bins / n_event_bins).

    Parameters:
        events: ndarray of shape [num_events, num_event_channels]
        sensor_size: size of the sensor that was used [W,H]
        ordering: ordering of the event tuple inside of events.
        time_window (None): window length in us.
        spike_count (None): number of events per frame.
        n_time_bins (None): fixed number of frames, sliced along time axis.
        n_event_bins (None): fixed number of frames, sliced along number of events in the recording.
        overlap (0.): overlap between frames defined either in time in us, number of events or number of bins.
        include_incomplete (False): if True, includes overhang slice when time_window or spike_count is specified. Not valid for bin_count methods.
        merge_polarities (False): if True, merge polarity channels to a single channel.

    Returns:
        numpy array of n rate-coded frames with channels p: (NxPxWxH)
