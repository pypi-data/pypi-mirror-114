Description: # Construct Hub
        
        This project maintains a [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) construct library
        that can be used to deploy instances of the Construct Hub in any AWS Account.
        
        ## Development
        
        The `test/devapp` directory includes an AWS CDK app designed for deploying the
        construct hub into a development account. This app is also used as a golden
        snapshot, so every time the construct changes, you'll see its snapshot updated.
        
        To bootstrap your developer account, use the following command:
        
        ```shell
        CDK_NEW_BOOTSTRAP=1 npx cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT/REGION
        ```
        
        Use the following tasks to work with the dev app. It will always work with the
        currently configured CLI account/region:
        
        * `yarn dev:synth` - synthesize into `test/devapp/cdk.out`
        * `yarn dev:deploy` - deploy to the current environment
        * `yarn dev:diff` - diff against the current environment
