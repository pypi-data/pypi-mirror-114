Description: # Estimating Population Size via Musicological "Icebergs"
        
        This repo contains the source code for Iceberg, a Python library that implements two methods for estimating the true size of a population given a collection of samples taken without replacement.
        For more details on how icebergs can be musicological, and what such objects have to do with estimating population size, see [Michael Scott Cuthbert, "Tipping the Iceberg: Missing Italian Polyphony from the Age of Schism," Musica Disciplina 54 (2009): 39â€“74](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25750547?seq=1).
        
        ## Installation & Use
        
        You can install Iceberg from the command line, just like any other Python library.
        ```shell
        $ pip install iceberg-est
        ```
        
        Once installed, you can use the functionality by importing the relevant modules.
        ```python
        import iceberg.estimate as est
        import iceberg.simulate as sim
        ```
        
        ## Contents
        
        * `iceberg` contains the Python library, including two modules
          * `iceberg.estimate` exposes functions that implement the estimation algorithms
          * `iceberg.simulate` exposes functions that simulate situations illustrating the functionality of the estimation algorithms
        * `docs` contains descriptions of the estimation algorithms, examples of their use, and comparisons of their effectiveness
