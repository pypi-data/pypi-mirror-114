# Python Image Utility (pyimgutil)

## About

This is a simple command-line utility, written in Python, for individual or
batch image processing.

There are a number of excellent programs out there that already do what this
program does, but sometimes a quick, lightweight, solution is nice to have
handy, too.

Features:

* convert
* crop
* resize
* rotate
* transpose
* change quality

If you find this program useful and there is a feature you would like to
suggest, see
[CONTRIBUTING](https://gitlab.com/emerac/pyimgutil/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
