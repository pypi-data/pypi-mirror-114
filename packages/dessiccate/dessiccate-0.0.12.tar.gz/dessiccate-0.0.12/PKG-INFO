        ## Introduction
        
        **Dessiccate** (*verb*): remove the moisture from (something); cause to become completely dry. 
        
        **Dry** (*adj*): without moisture. Also, an acronym for **DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF**.
        
        This project was started to house functions the author uses a lot so he doesn't have to writ them over and over again. I hope you find some of them useful!
