# leapfrog_msh_reader
A simple reader of leapfrog mesh files, without onerous installation requirements.


This was extracted from [GemGis](https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gemgis), a fantastic package. One downside to GemGIS is the installation requirements. 

This package is meant to be a lightweight, single use case, reader for leapfrog .msh files.
