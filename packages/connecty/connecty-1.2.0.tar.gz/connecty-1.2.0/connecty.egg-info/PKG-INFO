Description: # Connecty
        
        ### Install Python
        Get the installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        Although you installed python, you will not run python directly, but use the cmd
        
        ### Install Connecty
        Run this command in cmd/terminal NOT in python (installing python added the `pip` command)
        ```
        pip install connecty
        ```
        
        ### Create a config file
        Save a new text file with your config.
        The file must be in the .ini format and contain your token and all your connections.
         ```ini
        [BOT]
        token = tokengoeshere
        
        [my_connection_1]
        channels = 123456789 123456789 123456789
        
        [my_connection_2]
        channels = 123456789 123456789 123456789
        ```
        The first section should be called `[BOT]` and contain your token.
        Each subsequent section is a connection.
        The exact name doesn't matter so name them something memorable.
        
        ### Run the bot
        Run this command in cmd/terminal (installing connecty added the `connecty` command)
         ```
        connecty path/to/config.ini
         ```
