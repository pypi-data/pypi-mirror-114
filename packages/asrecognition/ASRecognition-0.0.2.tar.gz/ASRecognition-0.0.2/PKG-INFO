```

# How to use it?

```python
from asrecognition import ASREngine

# 1 - Load the ASR engine by a given language (may take a while for the first time)
asr = ASREngine("en")

# 2 - Use the ASR engine to transcribe a list of audio files
audio_paths = ["/path/to/sagan.mp3", "/path/to/asimov.wav"]
transcriptions = asr.transcribe(audio_paths)

# 3 - VoilÃ !
print(transcriptions)

# [
#  {"path": "/path/to/sagan.mp3", "transcription": "EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS REQUIRE EXTRAORDINARY EVIDENCE"},
#  {"path": "/path/to/asimov.wav", "transcription": "VIOLENCE IS THE LAST REFUGE OF THE INCOMPETENT"}
# ]
```
