    # vertvideo

    python package to help you convert video/audio files

    ## How to install

        pip install vertvideo

    ## How to run

    vertvideo was designed to run on multiple files, so you have to put then inside a folder so they can get processed in one single loop.

    `input_folder` is a mandatory arg.
    `output_format` always defaults to mp3 unless a different value is provided.

        vertvideo <input_folder> <output_format:?mp3>
