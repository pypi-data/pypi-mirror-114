Description: Piuma is an no-headache ultra-lightweight local document
         database written purely in python. With just over 50 lines (54 lines to be 
         precise) of active code and a source file that is 3.39kb (comments included) 
         piuma is designed without just the **absoulute bare** essentials in mind. In 
         the core version of Piuma there is no query language or any advanced search/modify 
         functions. In its current version Piuma only stores data in memory, I plan to add 
         local storage subpackage hopefully in the near future. This database should not be 
         taken too seriously and should really only be used for small projects and testing.
        
        ## Why you *should* use Piuma?
        * **Light and Small:** Piuma is written in 54 lines of code and can be sub 
        millisecond fast because of its memory storage
        * **Easy to Use:** Piuma runs out of the box and is easy to use and learn. 
        Piuma also requires no dependencies or external servers.
        * **Experimenting:** If you are trying something new and you need a fast 
        database that just works while testing then Piuma is a good choice.
        
        ## Why you *should not* use Piuma?
        * **Big Database:** Piuma was not designed to be used as a big database; Piuma 
        only runs *only* in memory (for now) so the limit of how big it could be comes 
        much quicker than other database
        * **ACID Guarantees:** Because of Piumas small nature it does not have room for 
        [ACID Guarantees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)
        * **Query Language:** Piuma does not have a query language (though I plan to 
        add one in a submodule in the future)
        
        ## Why is it called Piuma?
        
        Piuma is the Italian word for feather and (from what I feel) the word 
        feather can convay lightness. Also I am a little proud of the logo I made :]
