## Introduction

This project aims to control smart devices running **Sesame OS2** via **Bluetooth connection**. If you want to control them via the cloud service, please check [pysesame3](https://github.com/mochipon/pysesame3).

To be honest, this is my first time to use [`Bleak`](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak) which provides an asynchronous, cross-platform Bluetooth API. PRs are heavily welcome.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: [https://pysesameos2.readthedocs.io](https://pysesameos2.readthedocs.io)

## Tested Environments

* macOS 10.15.7, Python 3.9.5
* Raspberry Pi Zero W (Raspbian GNU/Linux 10, Raspberry Pi reference 2021-05-07), Python 3.7.3

## Supported devices

- [SESAME 3](https://jp.candyhouse.co/products/sesame3)
- [SESAME bot](https://jp.candyhouse.co/products/sesame3-bot)

## Features

* Scan all SESAME locks using BLE advertisements.
* Receive state changes (locked, handle position, etc.) that are actively reported from the device.
* Needless to say, locking and unlocking!

## Consideration

- The results of `pysesameos2` are merely from reverse engineering of [the official SDK](https://doc.candyhouse.co/). We have implemented just a small part of it, so you might run into some issues. Please do let me know if you find any problems!
- `pysesameos2` only supports devices that have already been initially configured using the official app. That is, `pysesameos2` cannot configure the locking position of your device.
- `pysesameos2` does not have, and will not have, any functionality related to the operation history of locks.  According to [the document](https://doc.candyhouse.co/ja/flow_charts#sesame-%E5%B1%A5%E6%AD%B4%E6%A9%9F%E8%83%BD), your lock's operation history is not stored in the lock itself, but on the cloud service. I personally recommend you to bring a Wi-Fi module to get the operation history uploaded and retrive it by [the API](https://doc.candyhouse.co/ja/SesameAPI#sesame%E3%81%AE%E5%B1%A5%E6%AD%B4%E3%82%92%E5%8F%96%E5%BE%97).

## Usage

Please take a look at the [`example`](https://github.com/mochipon/pysesameos2/tree/main/example) directory.
