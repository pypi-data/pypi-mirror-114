## Example

### Miscall OTP

To use [Citcall's Miscall Async API](https://docs.citcall.com/async/) to Asynchronous miscall, call the `account.async_miscall()` method.

The API can be called directly, using keyword argument, the keys match the [parameters of the API](https://docs.citcall.com/async/).

```python
motp = account.async_miscall(msisdn="msisdn", gateway=gateway)
```
If you want to able to do verify later use this example.
```python
motp = account.async_miscall(msisdn="msisdn", gateway=gateway, valid_time=valid_time, limit_try=limit_try)

```
Sync
```python
motp = account.sync_miscall(msisdn="msisdn", gateway=gateway)
```
```python
motp = account.sync_miscall(msisdn="msisdn", gateway=gateway, valid_time=valid_time, limit_try=limit_try)
```
The API response data can be accessed as dictonary
```python
print(motp)
```
### SMS
To use [Citcall's SMS API](https://docs.citcall.com/#sms) to send an SMS message, call the `citcall.sms()` method.

The API can be called directly, using using keyword argument, the keys match the [parameters of the API](https://docs.citcall.com/#sms).

```python
sms = account.sms(senderid="citcall", msisdn="msisdn", text="Hello World!")
```
The API response data can be accessed as dictonary

```python
print(sms)
```
