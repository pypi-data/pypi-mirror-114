Description: # About
        
        gitflow_authors_linter is an official plugin for [gitflow_linter](https://github.com/fighterpoul/gitflow_linter.git) command line tool.
        The plugin checks if currently a single author does not have too many open, ongoing feature branches. 
        Having multiple open feature branches by a single author might be an indicator that something is wrong with the process. On top of that, merging all those branches might be complex in a near future.
        
        # Quick Start
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install the linter from
        
        * pip
        
        ```
        pip install gitflow-linter-authors
        ```
        
        * or the source code
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/fighterpoul/gitflow_authors_linter.git
        cd gitflow_authors_linter
        git checkout 0.0.1
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        **HINT**: Run ``gitflow-linter-plugins`` to make sure that the plugin is available.
        
        ## Usages
        
        All you need to do is to: 
        
        1. Add new item in your YAML file that configures how `gitflow-linter` should work:
        
        ```yaml
        rules:
          no_multiple_open_features_per_author:
            max_open_branches_per_author: 4 # mandatory
        ```
        
        2. Run `gitflow-linter` - it should automatically recognize that the plugin must be used to check the given rule.
        
        # Motivation
        
        The plugin is there for the two reasons:
        1. Demonstrate how you may extend ``gitflow-linter`` by using plugins
        
        1. Provide an additional step that verifies a given repository against authors
        
        Therefore, it is supposed to be at the same time both useful and educative.
