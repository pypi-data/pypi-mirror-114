# Web Builder

Setting up new projects sucks. This helps.
=============

## Getting Started

Web Builder is easy to set up and run and has no package dependencies.

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.6
```

### Installing

Install the package through the pip package manager

```
pip install webbuilder
```

That's it! Now you'll be able to pull it up with a simple command from anywhere (unless modified, code is always deposited on Desktop)
```
python webbuilder
```
