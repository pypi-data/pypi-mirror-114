## About

filmbuff is a database front-end for managing film information. In other words,
it is a graphical user interface (GUI) application used to access and modify
film data contained in a SQLite database.

filmbuff is designed to appear and function in the same manner as a general
spreadsheet editor. This means that much of the same functionality is present
in filmbuff, such as saving and opening sheets, inserting rows, moving and
sorting columns, etc.

Here are a couple of notable features:

* To aid in data entry, filmbuff includes the ability to access an API
(application programming interface - usually used to retrieve information from
a web service) provided by [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (The Movie
Database). The [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) can be
used to search for and retrieve information about films. Obtaining a key from
TMDb is required in order to be able to use this functionality.

* Once you have populated your database with some data, you can export that
data to a tab-separated value (TSV) file. Many other programs (especially
spreadsheet editors) support importing/exporting TSV files. This allows you to
format the data and print it off to create an index for your film collection.
(filmbuff also supports importing TSV files).
