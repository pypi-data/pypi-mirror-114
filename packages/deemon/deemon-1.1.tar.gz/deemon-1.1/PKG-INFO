        ### Upgrading from 0.4.x or earlier
        Please note, the deemon CLI has changed significantly and no longer accepts many of the switches/commands that were previously used. This was done to provide a better, more natural, user experience.
        
        Please take a look at the help via `deemon --help` or by reading the [documentation](https://digitalec.github.io/deemon).
