        Universal Dataset Open Standard
        
        A place to develop an open standard for dataset 
        search, acquisition, reusable preparation, and sharing.
        
        # Target user stories
        
        - Search outside data (use several sources such as kaggle, github, named urls, etc?)
        - Get local copy of data 
            - Set rules for automatic updates of data
        - Search locally using:
            - General query expansion (using word2vec?)
            - Custom aliases
            - Fuzzy matching
        - Construct data feeds by combining multiple data feeds
        - Visualize relationships (to understand the data, spot errors, etc.)
        - Operable quick models (for quick-and-dirty inference)
