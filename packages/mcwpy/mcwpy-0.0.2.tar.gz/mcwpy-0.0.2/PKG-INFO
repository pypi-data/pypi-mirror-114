        ## Installation:  
        * First of all make sure you have one of the latest [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version installed on your computer.  
        * Ensure you also have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed: try running the command "`pip3 -V`" in a terminal.  
        * If this gets you an error message follow [these steps](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install it.  
        * Once you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed, run the command: "`pip3 install mcwpy`".  
        
        
        ## Usage:  
        Now you should be able to import the library in your new [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) programs you can use the project below to help you get started with the library:  
        ```py 
        from mcwpy import *
        ```  
        * Create and compile your own datapack.  
        * Once the datapack is generated, paste it in the *datapacks* folder of your [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/download) world.  
        * Type `/reload` to load the datapack.  
        * Have fun playing with your brand new handmade datapack!  
        
        
        ## Example:  
        ```python
        from mcwpy import *
        
        print('This example still needs to be created')
        ```  
        
        
        # 0.0.1  (2021/07/28)  
        - Fixed (or tried to) `LICENSE`, `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` looks on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/mcwpy/0.0.0/).  
        
        # Initial (2021/07/28)  
        - Created two functions to add or substract numbers together.  
        - Created a `setup.py` file to setup the library.  
        - Wrote `README.md`.  
        - Wrote `LICENSE`.  
        - Wrote `MANIFEST.md`.  
        - Created `REQUIREMENTS.txt`.  
        - Created `mcwpy\__init__.py`.  
        - Used `python3 setup.py sdist` in a terminal to create the library's first package.  
        - Used `twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*` to upload the library's first package on pypi.
