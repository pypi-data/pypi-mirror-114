class Datapack:
    """
    Datapacks can be placed in the .minecraft/saves/(world)/datapacks folder of a world. Each data pack is either a sub-folder or a .zip file \
        within the datapacks folder. After it is in the folder, a data pack is enabled for that world when the world is reloaded or loaded.
    Data packs load their data based on the load order. This order can be seen and altered by using the /datapack command and is stored in the \
        level.dat file.
    
    The player can also select data packs at the world creation screen by clicking the Data Packs button and dragging-and-dropping their data \
        pack folders/zip-files there. This is similar to the Resource Pack selection screen, and allows the player to enable data packs before \
        the world is generated, and easily customize the load order too.
