# PyPowNet: A Python Library for PowNet Model Optimization

[PowNet](https://github.com/kamal0013/PowNet/) is a least-cost optimization model for simulating the Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch of large-scale power systems.

It has been applied to model Cambodian, Laotian, and Thai power systems.

PyPowNetR improves the original implementation of PowNet and simplifies the model specification process.

It aims to help researchers to import their own power system data on the PowNet model and and serve as a benchmark for optimization solvers.

Ultimately, we hope that our effort will encourage more regions to adopt renewable energy sources in the power system.



# Requirements

PyPowNetR is written in Python 3.6. It requires the following Python packages: (i) Pyomo, (ii) NumPy, and (iii) Pandas. It also requires an optimization solver (e.g. CPLEX). 

PyPowNetR has been tested in Anaconda on Windows 10.



# How to run

If you have installed [glpk], this will execute the model using the data on Cambodian power system.

The script also generates .csv files containing the values of each decision variable.



# Citation

If you use PyPowNetR for your research, please cite the following papers (mainly from the original authors), which can be found in [this document](README_LONG.md)
