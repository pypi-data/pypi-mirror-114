----

This wrapper provides access through `Oríon`_ to several Bayesian optimization algorithms 
in the library `RoBO`_.

This ``orion.algo`` plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@Epistimio`_'s `cookiecutter-orion.algo`_ template.

Installation
------------

The RoBO wrapper is currently only supported on Linux.

Before installing RoBO, make sure you have ``libeigen`` and ``swig`` installed. 
On ubuntu, you can install them with ``apt-get``

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev swig

One of the dependencies of RoBO does not declare its dependencies and therefore we need
to install these dependencies first. The order of dependencies in ``requirements.txt`` 
reflects this order. To install them sequentially, use the following command

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -s https://git.io/JLnCA | grep -v "^#" | xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip install

Finally, you can install this package using PyPI

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install orion.algo.robo
