# Exe Launcher
All this does is launch .exe files directly from the command prompt, lol.

# Installation
```shell
pip install exeLauncher
```

# Importing
```py
import exeLauncher
from exeLauncher import *
```

# Usage/Using
```py
import exeLauncher
from exeLauncher import *

exeLauncher.launch()
```
After that in the command prompt you will get some popups...such as directory and filename and such, lol.

# LICENSE
