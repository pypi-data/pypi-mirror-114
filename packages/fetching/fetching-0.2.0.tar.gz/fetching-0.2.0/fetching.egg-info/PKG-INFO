Description: # fetching
        
        Python tool for automatically wrapping multiple (possibly private) Python libraries \
        into a single portable module file.
        
        ## purpose
        
        This tool can be used to automatically extract files from multiple repositories and \
        package them into a single portable module file.
        
        ## installation and usage
        
        The package is available on PyPi:
        
        ```shell
        python -m pip install fetching
        ```
        
        The library can be imported as follows:
        
        ```python
        from fetching import Fetching
        ```
        
        Fetching relies on the GitHub API, and as such won't work unless you either pass a valid \
        token to the `fetch_and_build()` method, or store one in either the `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` \
        environment variables.
        
        ## testing
        
        Running `test.py` relies on either the `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variables \
        being set.
