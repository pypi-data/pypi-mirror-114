Description: # additional_resources_menu
        
        A JupyterLab extension.
        
        This extension adds an Additional Resources submenu to the Help Menu in JupyterLab. This submenu provides links to 
        outside documentation as set in the `overrides.json` file (see Configuration).
        
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * JupyterLab >= 3.0
        
        ## Install
        
        To install the extension, enter the root repository folder and execute:
        
        ```bash
        pip install additional-resources-menu
        ```
        
        ## Uninstall
        
        To remove the extension, execute:
        
        ```bash
        pip uninstall additional-resources-menu
        ```
        
        If that does not work, you can directly delete the extension folder from Jupyter. See
        <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/directories.html#extensions">this link</a>
        to find where extensions are installed.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        The additional resources menu is populated with links that are specified in the `overrides.json` file. Click 
        <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/directories.html#overrides-json">this link</a> 
        to see where your overrides.json file is installed. This will set the additional resources for all users who
        access Jupyter through the shared install (so this file must be set for all virtual environments or installs).

        ### Development install
        
        Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.
        
        The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
        [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
        `yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.
        
        ```bash
        # Clone the repo to your local environment
        # Change directory to the additional_resources_menu directory
        # Install package in development mode
        pip install -e .
        # Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
        jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
        # Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
        jlpm run build
        ```
        
        You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.
        
        ```bash
        # Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
        jlpm run watch
        # Run JupyterLab in another terminal
        jupyter lab
        ```
        
        With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).
        
        By default, the `jlpm run build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter lab build --minimize=False
        ```
        
        ### Development uninstall
        
        ```bash
        pip uninstall additional_resources_menu
        ```
        
        In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`
        command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`
        folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `additional-resources-menu` within that folder.
