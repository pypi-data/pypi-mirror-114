"""
Tools for testing Python code and recording things like results, printed
output, or even traces of calls to certain functions.

harness.py

These tools start with a few functions for creating "payloads" which are
functions that take a context dictionary as a single argument and which
return dictionaries of new context slots to establish (it's no
coincidence that this same formula is what is expected of a context
builder function; payloads are context builders).

Once a payload is established, this module offers a variety of
augmentation functions which can create modified payloads with additional
functionality. Note that some of these augmentations interfere with each
other in minor ways, and should therefore be applied before others.

Also note that not every augmentation makes sense to apply to every kind
of payload (in particular, module import payloads don't make use of the
"module" context slot, so augmentations like with_module_decorations
can't be usefully applied to them).

"""
Ideal order in which to apply augmentations in this module when multiple
augmentations are being applied to the same payload. Because certain
augmentations interfere with others if not applied in the correct order,
applying them in order is important, although in certain cases special
applications might want to deviate from this order.

Note that even following this order, not all augmentations are really
compatible with each other. For example, if one were to use
`with_module_decorations` to perform intensive decoration (which is
somewhat time-consuming per-run) and also attempt to use
`sampling_distribution_of_results` with a large sample count, the
resulting payload might be prohibitively slow.

def tracing_function_calls(payload, trace_targets, state_function):
    """
    Augments a payload function such that calls to certain functions of
    interest during the payload's run are traced. This ends up creating
    a "trace" slot in the result context, which holds a trace object
    that consists of a list of trace entries.

    The `trace_targets` argument should be a sequence of strings
    identifying the names of functions to trace calls to. It may contain
    tuples, in which case calls to any function named in the tuple will
    be treated as calls to the first function in the tuple, which is
    useful for collapsing aliases like turtle.fd and turtle.forward.

    The `state_function` argument should be a one-argument function,
    which given a function name, captures some kind of state and returns
    a state object (typically a dictionary).

    Each trace entry in the resulting trace represents one function call
    in the outermost scope and is a dictionary with the following keys:

    - fname: The name of the function that was called.
    - args: A dictionary of arguments passed to the function, mapping
        argument names to their values. For calls to C functions (such as
        most built-in functions), arguments are not available, and this
        key will not be present.
    - result: The return value of the function. May be None if the
        function was terminated due to an exception, but there's no way
        to distinguish that from an intentional None return. For calls to
        C functions, this key will not be present.
    - pre_state: A state object resulting from calling the given
        state_function just before the traced function call starts, with
        the function name as its only argument. Calls made during the
        execution of the state function will not be traced.
    - post_state: The same kind of state object, but captured right
        before the return of the traced function.
    - during: A list of trace entries in the same format representing
        traced function calls which were initiated and returned before
        the end of the function call that this trace entry represents.

    Note that to inspect all function calls, the hierarchy must be
    traversed recursively to look at calls in "during" slots.

    Note that for *reasons*, functions named "setprofile" cannot be
    traced. Also note that since functions are identified by name,
    multiple functions with the same name occurring in different modules
    will be treated as the same function for tracing purposes, although
    this shouldn't normally matter.

    Note that in order to avoid tracing function calls made by payload
    augmentation, this augmentation should be applied before others.
