# cafeden 

## Overview

`cafeden` (from Vietnamese "cafe đen" or "black coffee") is a simple auto-clicker for keeping your computer awake. It monitors mouse and keyboard events to detect when the user is idle.

## How to run 

1. Download and install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads) 

2. Open a terminal (e.g. cmd on Windows) and install the package with [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
    ```bash
    pip install cafeden
    ```

3. Next, launch the application by running in the terminal:
    ```bash
    cafeden
    ```
    > Note: make sure the Python Scripts directory is in your PATH (e.g. `C:\Users\myuser\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x\Scripts`)

4. A system tray icon with a [phin cà phê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_iced_coffee) will appear. To quit the application, right-click on the icon and click on "Exit".

## Configuration 

Configuration is optional and is done through an [INI configuration file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file). To setup the configuration, create a file named `.cafeden` in your home directory (e.g. `~/.cafeden` in Linux and `C:\Users\myuser\.cafeden` in Windows systems). Default values, allowed sections and options are shown below.

```ini

# Time in seconds since the last mouse/keyboard event from which the user is considered to be idle
# Default: 45 seconds
idle_threshold = 1
# Action rate in seconds
# Default: 1 second
rate = 1

[mouse]
# Mouse action to perform, can be one of:
#   - click: perform a left click
#   - move: move the cursor between current position and the one specified in option 'position'
#   - wheel: scroll the wheel back and forth
# The rest of the configuration in this section is ignored if no action is supplied.
action = click
# Position as in: x, y. Empty means perform the action wherever the mouse is
position =

[keyboard]
# Keyboard action to perform, can be one of:
#   - press: press the specified key
#   - release: release the specified key
#   - press and release: press and release the specified key
# The rest of the configuration in this section is ignored if no action is supplied.
