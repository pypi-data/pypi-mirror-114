Compatibility
=============

This hotfix should be applied to the following versions of Plone:

* Plone 5.2.4 and any earlier 5.2.x version
* Plone 5.1.7 and any earlier 5.1x version
* Plone 5.0.10 and any earlier 5.0.x version
* Plone 4.3.20 and any earlier 4.x version

The hotfix is officially supported by the Plone security team on the
following versions of Plone in accordance with the Plone
`version support policy <https://plone.org/security/update-policy>`_: 4.3.20, 5.0.10, 5.1.7 and 5.2.4.

On Plone 4.3, 5.0 and 5.1 the hotfix is officially only supported on Python 2.7.
On Plone 5.2.X it is supported on Python 2.7 and Python 3.6/3.7/3.8.

The fixes included here will be incorporated into subsequent releases of Plone,
so Plone 5.2.5 and greater should not require this hotfix.


Zope
====

Zope is also affected.
New versions for Zope and other packages are available.
Upgrading to those is the recommended way.

If you cannot upgrade yet, you can try the Plone hotfix.
It has not been tested on Zope only, but we try not to let the Plone-specific code get in the way, so it should be okay.

These vulnerabilities mentioned above are relevant for Zope:

- Remote Code Execution via traversal in expressions via aliases.
  Fixes released in Zope 4.6 and 5.2.
- Remote Code Execution via traversal in expressions (no aliases).
  Fixes released in Zope 4.6.1 and 5.2.1.
- Various information disclosures.
  Fixes released in Products.PluggableAuthService 2.6.0, Products.GenericSetup 2.1.1, and Zope 4.5.5.
- Reflected XSS in various spots.
  Fixes released in Products.CMFCore 2.5.1 and Products.PluggableAuthService 2.6.2.
- Remote Code Execution via traversal in expressions via string formatter.
  Fixes released in Zope 4.6.2, which takes over the already stricter code from Zope 5.2.1.
- Remote Code Execution via Python Script.
  Fixes released in Zope 4.6.3 and 5.3.


Installation
============

Installation instructions can be found at
https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20210518

.. note::

  You may get an error when running buildout::

    Error: Couldn't find a distribution for 'Products.PloneHotfix20210518==1.0'.

  The most likely cause is that you use a too old Python or too old setuptools without "SNI" support.
  See this `community.plone.org post <https://community.plone.org/t/pypi-deprecation-of-support-for-non-sni-clients-breaks-buildout-for-older-plone-versions/13803>`_.

  Another cause could be that your buildout is trying to download the hotfix via http or from an older PyPI index.
  In the buildout section of your buildout, make sure you use the correct index::

    [buildout]
    index = https://pypi.org/simple/
